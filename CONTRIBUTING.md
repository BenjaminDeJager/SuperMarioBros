# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINE

## Description

Your contribution consists of three parts.

1. In **week** 4 you will attend the planning session in which we will
select a project lead for the quarter. During this session you commit to implementing one feature of the class project.
2. Second, in **week 7** you will submit your implementation for code review.
Next, in week 8 you will submit your code review of another studentâ€™s implementation.
3. Finally, in **week 10** you will submit your final code, after review, and your response to your code review. All code that passes review will be added to the project.
4. It is **not necessary** for your code to be merged to receive extra credits. However, it might be the case when you submit a very low quality code.
5. You can work individually or as a group on implementing an assigned feature. However, it is recommended to contribute as a group.

## Branch naming convention

Please naming your branch using the following rule:

- your-name/your-task
- your-group-name/your-task

Example: hungvu/contributing-guideline

## Task assinging and pull request

1. In **week 7**, you will make a pull request to submit your code.
2. Tasks will be divided into issues and put into project board. A story board will clearly indicate the task for each person and/or group. It is located in **Projects** tab.
3. All pull requests must pass an automated test run by Github action. As of now, it simply checks whether your code is compilable or not. There can be more tests added later on.

## Submitting pull request

1. You will not directly push the changes to a master branch. Master branch is protected.
2. Your code will stay on your own branch. You might create an upstream branch. Each branch is only accessible by contributors of that one.
3. At **week 7**, you will make a pull request and your code will be reviewed by Hung Vu (@hunghvu), Benjamin (@BenjaminDeJager), and professor Chris (@algorithm0r).
4. For the pull requests, please document what you changed, updated and any potential or discovered bugs which haven't been fixed.
5. For the pull requests, please link you pull request with an assigned issue. For more information, <https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue>
