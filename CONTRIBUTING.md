# CONTRIBUTING GUIDELINE

## Description

Your contribution consists of three parts.

1. In **week** 4 you will attend the planning session in which we will
select a project lead for the quarter. During this session you commit to implementing one feature of the class project.
2. Second, in **week 7** you will submit your implementation for code review.
Next, in week 8 you will submit your code review of another studentâ€™s implementation.
3. Finally, in **week 10** you will submit your final code, after review, and your response to your code review. All code that passes review will be added to the project.
4. It is **not necessary** for your code to be merged to receive extra credits. However, it might be the case when you submit a very low quality code.
5. You can work individually or as a group on implementing an assigned feature. However, it is recommended to contribute as a group.

## Submitting changes

1. You will not directly push the changes to a master branch.
2. Your code will stay on your own branch. You might create an upstream branch. Each branch is only accessible by contributors of that one.
3. At **week 7**, you will make a pull request and your code will be reviewed by Hung Vu (@hunghvu), Benjamin (@BenjaminDeJager), and professor Chris (@algorithm0r).
4. For the pull requests, please document what you changed, updated and any potential or discovered bugs which haven't been fixed.

## Branch naming convention

Please naming your branch using the following rule:

- your-name/your-task
- your-group-name/your-task
